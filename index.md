![Profile]({{site.url}}/assets/profile.JPG){:class="img-responsive"}

  Iâ€™m an analytics manager working in the financial services industry. I working for Oliver Wyman in London then Standard Chartered in Singapore and HSBC in Hong Kong. Although I worked on many different projects and topics throughout my career, it has always been about applying complex analytics and technology to practical business problems. 
  
  For a long time, SAS, SQL and Excel were the tools of this trade. However, in recent years, Python has been growing at an exponentially with ever more packages that provide functionality beyond those available to the older tools. 
  
  I decided to embark on a personal journey to teach myself Python by starting hobby projects and soon found myself working on things I had not thought possible before. This blog is a personal record of this journey and a way to share what I've learnt with others.
  
  My coding interests are currently natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning and learning to use Amazon Web Services.
  
  My non-coding interests are running, boxing and muay thai.
