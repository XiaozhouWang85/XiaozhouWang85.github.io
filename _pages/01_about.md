I moved to the UK at the age of 5 from China and grew up near London. I studied Economics at the London School of Economics and then worked for a consulting firm in London. Although I had the chance to travel to many different countries with my consulting job, I felt that I had spent too long based in just one city. I made the move to work in Singapore and then Hong Kong were I currently live. From my travels, what I have found is that despite many surface level differences, there is greater similarity between workplaces than differences. People face the same challenges, conflicts and aspirations whether it is London, Istanbul, Bucharest, Singapore or Hong Kong. As a child, these places seemed strange, exotic and far off places to me but as an adult they have become places where people much like myself live and work.

My first job was as a consultant working in the financial services industry with Oliver Wyman. Consultants are typically brought in when the task is a one-off, the company doesn't have the right people to do the task or the problem is so painful that no one in the company wants to pick it up. It was a tough job requiring a lot of travel on top of already long hours (typically 70-80 hours a week) but was a great first job. I learnt what hard work really meant and it also set high personal standards for every professional interaction whether it was sending an email to the client or making sure reports and analysis supporting them were error free. It was also great to work with really smart people and to be in an intensely competitive environment where your performance was always being scrutinised. The most important thing I learnt from this time however was how often problems we were called in to solve came from senior managers not communicating with the technical people "on the ground". Many projects that were successful succeeded because we were able to understand both the business challenge as well as the technical one and devise a solution.

All of this however didn't prepare me for what work would be like in a large organisation like Standard Chartered. When a consultant is given a project, there is usually a fairly senior person in the organisation that has spent considerable money on it. This means that getting key people engaged is typically a case of asking and then escalating issues up the chain of command if the answer is no. Now it is up to me to get the right senior management attention and apply a lot more tact and diplomacy in all interactions. Day to day work also changed considerably. Although there were periodic presentations to the client as a consultant, day to day interactions were primarily with other consultants who are typically highly motivated Oxford / Cambridge alumni. Now I worked with people from a wide variety of backgrounds with different levels of motivation. Sometimes it was a case of realising that some people just have non-work priorities that were more important to them whether it was achievement in sports or spending time with their families. Other times it was realising that the workplace was "Darwinian" in that someone with poor technical skills probably was an expert political manipulator to have gotten their positions.

By now, I had moved to HSBC and I was quickly learning how to get things done in these large organisations where not everyone was an Oxford / Cambridge grad. First was realising that I needed others in order to succeed. As a consultant, I could take it for granted that others would play their part well and ultimately assessment was fair and very much personal. Succeeding in larger organisations was about understanding what are the motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the other players (other departments). Finding common ground and win-win situations with some while realising that conflict was inevitable with others. For those unfamiliar with corporate politics, "conflict" simply means competing for the recognition / favour of senior management.  

So finally this brings us to the data science community, Python and its ecosystem of tools. As I start to learn Python, I immediately see its potential to completely change the way teams are structured. Why have dedicated data warehousing teams who try to second guess business needs when Hadoop can transform large amounts of raw data on demand? Why have different teams handle model development and model implementation when now it can be done with a few lines of Python code? I know also that for organisations to truly reap the benefits of new technologies they will need to undertake politically difficult re-organisations and there will be plenty of both winners and losers from the political battles.
