I’m an analytics manager working in the financial services industry. I worked for Oliver Wyman in London then Standard Chartered in Singapore and HSBC in Hong Kong. Although I worked on many different projects and topics throughout my career, it has always been about applying complex analytics and technology to practical business problems. 

For a long time, SAS, SQL and Excel were the tools of this trade. However, in recent years, Python has been growing exponentially with many machine learning and deep learning tools catering to the Python community. 

I decided to embark on a personal journey to teach myself Python by starting hobby projects and soon found myself working on things I had not thought possible before. I'm starting this blog in order to share with others who are also on their own learning journey.

My coding interests are currently natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning and learning to use Amazon Web Services. Outside of work and coding, my interests are running, boxing and muay thai.
